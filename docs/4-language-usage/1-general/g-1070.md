# G-1070: Avoid nesting comment blocks.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability

## Reason

Having an end-of-comment within a block comment will end that block-comment. This does not only influence your code but is also very hard to read.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
BEGIN
   /* comment one -- nested comment two */
   NULL;
   -- comment three /* nested comment four */
   NULL;
END;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
BEGIN
   /* comment one, comment two */
   NULL;
   -- comment three, comment four
   NULL;
END;
/
```
