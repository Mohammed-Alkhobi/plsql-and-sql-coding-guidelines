# G-2340: Always define your VARCHAR2 variables using CHAR SEMANTIC (if not defined anchored).

!!! tip "Minor"
    Reliability

## Reason

Changes to the `NLS_LENGTH_SEMANTIC` will only be picked up by your code after a recompilation.

In a multibyte environment a `VARCHAR2(10)` definition may not necessarily hold 10 characters, when multibyte characters a part of the value that should be stored unless the definition was done using the char semantic.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE types_up IS
   SUBTYPE description_type IS VARCHAR2(200);
END types_up;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE types_up IS
   SUBTYPE description_type IS VARCHAR2(200 CHAR);
END types_up;
/
```
