# G-2320: Avoid using VARCHAR data type.

!!! warning "Major"
    Portability

## Reason

Do not use the `VARCHAR` data type. Use the `VARCHAR2` data type instead. Although the `VARCHAR` data type is currently synonymous with `VARCHAR2`, the `VARCHAR` data type is scheduled to be redefined as a separate data type used for variable-length character strings compared with different comparison semantics.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE types_up IS
   SUBTYPE description_type IS VARCHAR(200);
END types_up;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE types_up IS
   SUBTYPE description_type IS VARCHAR2(200 CHAR);
END types_up;
/
```
