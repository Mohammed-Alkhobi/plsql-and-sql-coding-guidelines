# G-2220: Try to use PLS_INTEGER instead of NUMBER for arithmetic operations with integer values. 

!!! tip "Minor"
    Efficiency

## Reason

`PLS_INTEGER` having a length of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, on a 32bit system.

There are many reasons to use `PLS_INTEGER` instead of `NUMBER`:

* `PLS_INTEGER` uses less memory
* `PLS_INTEGER` uses machine arithmetic, which is up to three times faster than library arithmetic, which is used by `NUMBER`.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY constants_up IS
   co_big_increase CONSTANT NUMBER(5,0) := 1;
   
   FUNCTION big_increase RETURN NUMBER IS
   BEGIN
      RETURN co_big_increase;
   END big_increase;
END constants_up;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY constants_up IS
   co_big_increase CONSTANT PLS_INTEGER := 1;
   
   FUNCTION big_increase RETURN PLS_INTEGER IS
   BEGIN
      RETURN co_big_increase;
   END big_increase;
END constants_up;
/
```
