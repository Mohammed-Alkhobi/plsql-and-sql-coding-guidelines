# G-2230: Try to use SIMPLE_INTEGER datatype when appropriate. 

!!! tip "Minor"
    Efficiency

## Restriction

ORACLE 11g or later

## Reason

`SIMPLE_INTEGER` does no checks on numeric overflow, which results in better performance compared to the other numeric datatypes.

With ORACLE 11g, the new data type `SIMPLE_INTEGER` has been introduced. It is a sub-type of `PLS_INTEGER` and covers the same range. The basic difference is that `SIMPLE_INTEGER` is always `NOT NULL`.  When the value of the declared variable is never going to be null then you can declare it as `SIMPLE_INTEGER`. Another major difference is that you will never face a numeric overflow using `SIMPLE_INTEGER` as this data type wraps around without giving any error. `SIMPLE_INTEGER` data type gives major performance boost over `PLS_INTEGER` when code is compiled in `NATIVE` mode, because arithmetic operations on SIMPLE_INTEGER type are performed directly at the hardware level.


## Example (bad)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY constants_up IS
   co_big_increase CONSTANT NUMBER(5,0) := 1;
   
   FUNCTION big_increase RETURN NUMBER IS
   BEGIN
      RETURN co_big_increase;
   END big_increase;
END constants_up;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY constants_up IS
   co_big_increase CONSTANT SIMPLE_INTEGER := 1;
   
   FUNCTION big_increase RETURN SIMPLE_INTEGER IS
   BEGIN
      RETURN co_big_increase;
   END big_increase;
END constants_up;
/
```
