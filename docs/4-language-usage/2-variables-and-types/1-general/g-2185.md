# G-2185: Avoid using overly short names for explicitly or implicitly declared identifiers. 

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability

## Reason

You should ensure that the name you have chosen well defines its purpose and usage. While you can save a few keystrokes typing very short names, the resulting code is obscure and hard for anyone besides the author to understand.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
DECLARE
   i INTEGER;
   c CONSTANT INTEGER := 1;
   e EXCEPTION;   
BEGIN
   i := c;
EXCEPTION
   WHEN e THEN
      NULL;
END;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
DECLARE
   l_sal_comm     INTEGER;
   co_my_constant CONSTANT INTEGER := 1;
   e_my_exception EXCEPTION;   
BEGIN
   l_sal_comm := co_my_constant;
EXCEPTION
   WHEN e_my_exception THEN
      NULL;
END;
/
```
