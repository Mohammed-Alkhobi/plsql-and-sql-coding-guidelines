# G-4385: Never use a cursor for loop to check whether a cursor returns data.

!!! warning "Major"
    Efficiency

## Reason

You might process more data than required, which leads to bad performance.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
DECLARE
   l_employee_found BOOLEAN := FALSE;
   CURSOR c_employees IS
      SELECT employee_id, last_name
        FROM employees;
BEGIN
   <<check_employees>>
   FOR r_employee IN c_employees
   LOOP
      l_employee_found := TRUE;
   END LOOP check_employees;
END;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
DECLARE
   l_employee_found BOOLEAN := FALSE;
   CURSOR c_employees IS
      SELECT employee_id, last_name
        FROM employees;
   r_employee c_employees%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
   OPEN c_employees;
   FETCH c_employees INTO r_employee;
   l_employee_found := c_employees%FOUND;
   CLOSE c_employees;
END;
/
```
