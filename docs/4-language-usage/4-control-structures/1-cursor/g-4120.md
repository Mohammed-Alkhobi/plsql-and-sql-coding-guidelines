# G-4120: Avoid using %NOTFOUND directly after the FETCH when working with BULK OPERATIONS and LIMIT clause. 

!!! danger "Critical"
    Reliability

## Reason

`%NOTFOUND` is set to `TRUE` as soon as less than the number of rows defined by the `LIMIT` clause has been read.

## Example (bad)

The employees table holds 107 rows. The example below will only show 100 rows as the cursor attribute `NOTFOUND` is set to true as soon as the number of rows to be fetched defined by the limit clause is not fulfilled anymore.

``` sql
DECLARE
   CURSOR c_employees IS 
      SELECT *
        FROM employees
       ORDER BY employee_id;

   TYPE t_employees_type IS TABLE OF c_employees%ROWTYPE;
   t_employees t_employees_type;
   co_bulk_size CONSTANT SIMPLE_INTEGER := 10;
BEGIN
   OPEN c_employees;
   
   <<process_employees>>
   LOOP
      FETCH c_employees BULK COLLECT INTO t_employees LIMIT co_bulk_size;
      EXIT process_employees WHEN c_employees%NOTFOUND;

      <<display_employees>>
      FOR i IN 1..t_employees.COUNT()
      LOOP
         sys.dbms_output.put_line(t_employees(i).last_name);
      END LOOP display_employees;
   END LOOP process_employees;

   CLOSE c_employees;
END;
/
```

## Example (better)

This example will show all 107 rows but execute one fetch too much (12 instead of 11).

``` sql
DECLARE
   CURSOR c_employees IS 
      SELECT *
        FROM employees
       ORDER BY employee_id;

   TYPE t_employees_type IS TABLE OF c_employees%ROWTYPE;
   t_employees t_employees_type;
   co_bulk_size CONSTANT SIMPLE_INTEGER := 10;
BEGIN
   OPEN c_employees;
   
   <<process_employees>>
   LOOP
      FETCH c_employees BULK COLLECT INTO t_employees LIMIT co_bulk_size;
      EXIT process_employees WHEN t_employees.COUNT() = 0;
      <<display_employees>>
      FOR i IN 1..t_employees.COUNT()
      LOOP
         sys.dbms_output.put_line(t_employees(i).last_name);
      END LOOP display_employees;
   END LOOP process_employees;
   
   CLOSE c_employees;
END;
/
```

## Example (good)

This example does the trick (11 fetches only to process all rows)

``` sql
DECLARE
   CURSOR c_employees IS 
      SELECT *
        FROM employees
       ORDER BY employee_id;

   TYPE t_employees_type IS TABLE OF c_employees%ROWTYPE;
   t_employees t_employees_type;
   co_bulk_size CONSTANT SIMPLE_INTEGER := 10;
BEGIN
   OPEN c_employees;
   
   <<process_employees>>
   LOOP
      FETCH c_employees BULK COLLECT INTO t_employees LIMIT co_bulk_size;
      <<display_employees>>
      FOR i IN 1..t_employees.COUNT()
      LOOP
         sys.dbms_output.put_line(t_employees(i).last_name);
      END LOOP display_employees;
      EXIT process_employees WHEN t_employees.COUNT() <> co_bulk_size;
   END LOOP process_employees;
   
   CLOSE c_employees;
END;
/
```
