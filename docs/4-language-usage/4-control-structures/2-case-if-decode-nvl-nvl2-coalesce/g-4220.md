# G-4220: Try to use CASE rather than DECODE.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability, Portability

## Reason

`DECODE` is an ORACLE specific function hard to understand and restricted to SQL only. The “newer” `CASE` function is much more common has a better readability and may be used within PL/SQL too.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
select decode(dummy, 'X', 1 
                   , 'Y', 2
                   , 'Z', 3
                        , 0)
  from dual;
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
select case dummy
          when 'X' then 1
          when 'Y' then 2
          when 'Z' then 3
          else 0
       end
  from dual;
```
