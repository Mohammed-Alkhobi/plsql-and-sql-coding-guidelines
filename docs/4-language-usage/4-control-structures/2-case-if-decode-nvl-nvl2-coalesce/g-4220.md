# G-4220: Try to use CASE rather than DECODE.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability, Portability

## Reason

`DECODE` is an ORACLE specific function hard to understand and restricted to SQL only. The “newer” `CASE` function is much more common has a better readability and may be used within PL/SQL too.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
SELECT DECODE(dummy, 'X', 1 
                   , 'Y', 2
                   , 'Z', 3
                        , 0)
  FROM dual;
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
SELECT CASE dummy
          WHEN 'X' THEN 1
          WHEN 'Y' THEN 2
          WHEN 'Z' THEN 3
          ELSE 0
       END
  FROM dual;
```
