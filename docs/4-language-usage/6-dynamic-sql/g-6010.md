# G-6010: Always use a character variable to execute dynamic SQL.

!!! warning "Major"
    Maintainability, Testability

## Reason

Having the executed statement in a variable makes it easier to debug your code (e.g. by logging the statement that failed).

## Example (bad)

``` sql
DECLARE
   l_next_val employees.employee_id%TYPE;
BEGIN
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'select employees_seq.nextval from dual' INTO l_next_val;
END;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
DECLARE
   l_next_val employees.employee_id%TYPE;
   co_sql CONSTANT types_up.big_string_type := 
       'select employees_seq.nextval from dual';
BEGIN
   EXECUTE IMMEDIATE co_sql INTO l_next_val;
END;
/
```
