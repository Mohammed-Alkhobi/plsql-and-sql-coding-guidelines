# G-3130: Try to use ANSI SQL-92 join syntax.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability, Portability

## Reason

ANSI SQL-92 join syntax supports the full outer join. A further advantage of the ANSI SQL-92 join syntax is the separation of the join condition from the query filters.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
SELECT e.employee_id
      ,e.last_name
      ,e.first_name
      ,d.department_name
  FROM employees e
      ,departments d 
 WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
   AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM e.hire_date) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM SYSDATE);
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
SELECT emp.employee_id
      ,emp.last_name
      ,emp.first_name
      ,dept.department_name
  FROM      employees   emp
       JOIN departments dept ON dept.department_id = emp.department_id
 WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM emp.hire_date) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM SYSDATE);
```
