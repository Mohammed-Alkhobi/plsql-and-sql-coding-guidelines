# G-3140: Try to use anchored records as targets for your cursors. 

!!! warning "Major"
    Maintainability, Reliability

## Reason

Using cursor-anchored records as targets for your cursors results enables the possibility of changing the structure of the cursor without regard to the target structure.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
DECLARE
   CURSOR c_employees IS
      SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
        FROM employees;
   l_employee_id employees.employee_id%TYPE;
   l_first_name  employees.first_name%TYPE;
   l_last_name   employees.last_name%TYPE;
BEGIN
   OPEN c_employees;
   FETCH c_employees INTO l_employee_id, l_first_name, l_last_name;
   <<process_employees>>
   WHILE c_employees%FOUND
   LOOP
      -- do something with the data
      FETCH c_employees INTO l_employee_id, l_first_name, l_last_name;
   END LOOP process_employees;
   CLOSE c_employees;
END;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
DECLARE
   CURSOR c_employees IS
      SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
        FROM employees;
   r_employee c_employees%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
   OPEN c_employees;
   FETCH c_employees INTO r_employee;
   <<process_employees>>
   WHILE c_employees%FOUND
   LOOP
      -- do something with the data
      FETCH c_employees INTO r_employee;
   END LOOP process_employees;
   CLOSE c_employees;
END;
/
```
