# G-3110: Always specify the target columns when coding an insert statement.

!!! warning "Major"
    Maintainability, Reliability

## Reason

Data structures often change. Having the target columns in your insert statements will lead to change-resistant code.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
INSERT INTO departments
     VALUES (departments_seq.nextval
            ,'Support'
            ,100
            ,10);
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
INSERT INTO departments (department_id 
                        ,department_name
                        ,manager_id
                        ,location_id)
     VALUES (departments_seq.nextval
            ,'Support'
            ,100
            ,10);
```
