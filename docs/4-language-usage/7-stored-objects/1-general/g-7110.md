# G-7110: Try to use named notation when calling program units.

!!! warning "Major"
    Changeability, Maintainability

## Reason

Named notation makes sure that changes to the signature of the called program unit do not affect your call.

This is not needed for standard functions like (`TO_CHAR`, `TO_DATE`, `NVL`, `ROUND`, etc.) but should be followed for any other stored object having more than one parameter.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
DECLARE
   r_employee employees%rowtype;
   co_id CONSTANT employees.employee_id%type := 107;
BEGIN
   employee_api.employee_by_id(r_employee, co_id);
END;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
DECLARE
   r_employee employees%rowtype;
   co_id CONSTANT employees.employee_id%type := 107;
BEGIN
   employee_api.employee_by_id(out_row => r_employee, in_employee_id => co_id);
END;
/
```
