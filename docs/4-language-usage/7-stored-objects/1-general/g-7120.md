# G-7120	Always add the name of the program unit to its end keyword.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability

## Reason

It's a good alternative for comments to indicate the end of program units, especially if they are lengthy or nested.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY employee_api IS
   FUNCTION employee_by_id (in_employee_id IN employees.employee_id%TYPE)
      RETURN employees%rowtype IS
      r_employee employees%rowtype;
   BEGIN
      SELECT *
        INTO r_employee
        FROM employees
       WHERE employee_id = in_employee_id;
      
      RETURN r_employee;
   EXCEPTION
      WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
         NULL;
      WHEN TOO_MANY_ROWS THEN
         RAISE;
   END;
END;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY employee_api IS
   FUNCTION employee_by_id (in_employee_id IN employees.employee_id%TYPE)
      RETURN employees%rowtype IS
      r_employee employees%rowtype;
   BEGIN
      SELECT *
        INTO r_employee
        FROM employees
       WHERE employee_id = in_employee_id;
      
      RETURN r_employee;
   EXCEPTION
      WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
         NULL;
      WHEN TOO_MANY_ROWS THEN
         RAISE;
   END employee_by_id;
END employee_api;
