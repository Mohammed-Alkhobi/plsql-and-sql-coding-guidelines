# G-7150: Try to remove unused parameters.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Efficiency, Maintainability

## Reason

You should go through your programs and remove any partameter that is no longer used.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY department_api IS
   FUNCTION name_by_id (in_department_id IN departments.department_id%TYPE
                       ,in_manager_id    IN departments.manager_id%TYPE)
      RETURN departments.department_name%TYPE IS
      l_department_name departments.department_name%TYPE;
   BEGIN
      <<find_department>>
      BEGIN
         SELECT department_name
           INTO l_department_name
           FROM departments
          WHERE department_id = in_department_id;
      EXCEPTION
         WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND OR TOO_MANY_ROWS THEN 
            l_department_name := NULL;
      END find_department;
      
      RETURN l_department_name;
   END name_by_id;
END department_api;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY department_api IS
   FUNCTION name_by_id (in_department_id IN departments.department_id%TYPE)
      RETURN departments.department_name%TYPE IS
      l_department_name departments.department_name%TYPE;
   BEGIN
      <<find_department>>
      BEGIN
         SELECT department_name
           INTO l_department_name
           FROM departments
          WHERE department_id = in_department_id;
      EXCEPTION
         WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND OR TOO_MANY_ROWS THEN 
            l_department_name := NULL;
      END find_department;
      
      RETURN l_department_name;
   END name_by_id;
END department_api;
/
