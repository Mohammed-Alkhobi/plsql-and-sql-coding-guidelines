# G-7320: Avoid using RETURN statements in a PROCEDURE.

!!! warning "Major"
    Maintainability, Testability

## Reason

Use of the `RETURN` statement is legal within a procedure in PL/SQL, but it is very similar to a `GOTO`, which means you end up with poorly structured code that is hard to debug and maintain. 

A good general rule to follow as you write your PL/SQL programs is "one way in and one way out". In other words, there should be just one way to enter or call a program, and there should be one way out, one exit path from a program (or loop) on successful termination. By following this rule, you end up with code that is much easier to trace, debug, and maintain.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY my_package IS
   PROCEDURE my_procedure IS
      l_idx SIMPLE_INTEGER := 1;
      co_modulo CONSTANT SIMPLE_INTEGER := 7;
   BEGIN
      <<mod7_loop>>
      LOOP
        IF MOD(l_idx,co_modulo) = 0 THEN
           RETURN;
        END IF;
         
        l_idx := l_idx + 1;
      END LOOP mod7_loop;
   END my_procedure;
END my_package;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY my_package IS
   PROCEDURE my_procedure IS
      l_idx SIMPLE_INTEGER := 1;
      co_modulo CONSTANT SIMPLE_INTEGER := 7;
   BEGIN
      <<mod7_loop>>
      LOOP
        EXIT mod7_loop WHEN MOD(l_idx,co_modulo) = 0;
         
        l_idx := l_idx + 1;
      END LOOP mod7_loop;
   END my_procedure;
END my_package;
/
```
